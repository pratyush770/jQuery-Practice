        jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event
        handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[4] As
        of Aug 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites.[5] Web analysis indicates that it is
        the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any
        other JavaScript library.[5][6]

        jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations,
        handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create
        plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level
        interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the
        jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.

        The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal, and manipulation—enabled by its selector
        engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures.
        This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating
        the creation of the standard Selectors API.[7]
